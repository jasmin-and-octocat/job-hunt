we are creating a job board website and need to implement the APIs and the UI (may need to create new pages and components in the current next.js 15 website using app router.)

This is the Swagger API documentation, I'm using strapi headless CMS.

All the API schema.json from the strapi folder has been copied in there in the folder `api-references` in the root of the project. Use that to implement the APIs.
